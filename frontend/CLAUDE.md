# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ðŸŽ¯ Startup Coding Principles

*EARLY-STAGE STARTUP RULES - FOLLOW THESE:*

1. *Prioritize simple, readable code with minimal abstraction* - avoid premature optimization. Strive for elegant, minimal solutions that reduce complexity. Focus on clear implementation that's easy to understand and iterate on as the product evolves.

2. *DO NOT preserve backward compatibility* unless the user specifically requests it. Move fast and break things that need breaking.

## Project Overview

Maily is an email management application built as a cross-platform mobile app using React Native and Expo. The frontend provides intuitive email handling with modern mobile UX patterns and cross-platform deployment capabilities.

## Development Commands

```bash
bun install       # Install dependencies
bun run start     # Development server with Expo
bun run android   # Run on Android device/emulator
bun run ios       # Run on iOS device/simulator
bun run web       # Run on web browser
```

*IMPORTANT:*

â€¢ Development server uses Expo CLI with hot reload and fast refresh
â€¢ Always use Bun instead of npm/yarn for package management
â€¢ All code must be TypeScript - no plain JavaScript files
â€¢ Cross-platform compatibility is essential - test on all platforms
â€¢ Uses Expo's new architecture for improved performance

## Architecture

*Frontend (React Native + Expo)*
â€¢ React Native with Expo SDK 53 and TypeScript strict mode
â€¢ File-based routing through `app/` directory structure
â€¢ Cross-platform deployment (iOS, Android, Web)
â€¢ Expo's registerRootComponent for application bootstrapping
â€¢ Modern React patterns with hooks and functional components

*Development Setup*
â€¢ Expo development server with hot module replacement
â€¢ TypeScript configuration extending Expo's base setup
â€¢ Bun as package manager and runtime for faster operations
â€¢ Platform-specific configurations in app.json

## Key Configuration Files

â€¢ `package.json` - Dependencies and Expo scripts
â€¢ `app.json` - Expo configuration with platform settings and bundle IDs
â€¢ `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript strict mode extending Expo base
â€¢ `index.ts` - Application entry point with registerRootComponent
â€¢ `bun.lock` - Dependency lockfile for consistent installations

## Development Notes

â€¢ All screens and components are in `app/` directory using Expo Router
â€¢ Entry point flows: `index.ts` â†’ registers App component â†’ `app/index.tsx`
â€¢ Bundle identifiers: `com.amin598.frontend` for both iOS and Android
â€¢ New architecture enabled for performance improvements
â€¢ Edge-to-edge display support on Android
â€¢ Adaptive icons and splash screens configured
â€¢ Uses file-based routing - no manual route configuration needed
â€¢ NEVER EVER COMMIT A CHANGE, PUSH OR EVEN STAGE CHANGES WHEN NOT SPECIFICALLY ASKED
